## Retention of personal data

1.

For accounting purposes we keep the transactional data for 7 years.
2. We may retain personal data for longer periods than required by law if it is in our legitimate business interests and is not directly prohibited by the applicable law (normally up to ten years after the termination of the relationship). If our agreement is terminated we reserve our right to retain and access the data for so long as required to comply with applicable laws. We will continue to use and disclose such personal data in accordance with this privacy policy.
3. Once the period of retaining your personal data is over, we will delete, or anonymize your personal data. The data which is anonymized (irrevocably detached from you) may be used for our internal purposes.

## Your Legal Rights

1. Under certain circumstances, you have the following rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. You have the right to:
    - **Request access** to your personal data (commonly known as a data subject access request). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
    - **Request correction** of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
    - **Request erasure** of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information without compelling legal grounds, or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law.
    Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal or technical (see about the blockchain restrictions) reasons, which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
    - **Object to processing** your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party), and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms.
    You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information, which override your rights and freedoms.
    - Request **restriction of processing** of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:
        1. if you want us to establish the data's accuracy;
        2. where our use of the data is without compelling legal grounds but you do not want us to erase it;
        3. where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or
        4. you have objected to our use of your data, but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it;
        5. you may prohibit the processing of the personal data for direct marketing purposes as well as to refuse the advertisements and offers at any time by informing us thereof.
    - **the transfer** of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information, which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
    - Withdraw **consent at any time** where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.

2. You can exercise any of these rights at any time by contacting us.
3. We reserve the right to decline your request to exercise any of the rights under this section if we are not legally obligated to provide such rights under the laws of the jurisdiction of your residence.
4. You have a right to lodge a complaint to the Estonian Data Protection Inspectorate (e-mail address: [info@aki.ee](mailto:info@aki.ee); telephone: +372 5620 2341 or +372 627 4135; address: Tatari 39, Tallinn 10134, Estonia) if you consider that processing of your personal data infringes your rights and interests under the law.
