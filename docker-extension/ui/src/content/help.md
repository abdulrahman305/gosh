# GOSH
Secure Software Supply Chain achieved through record-setting blockchain tech, distributed programming and decentralized architecture - integrated into the same familiar git, no workflow adjustment required.

## Motivation

Software Supply Chain is a high-impact area. Yet there exists a distinctive lack of secure, trustless, verifiable, and transparent delivery of source code/binaries to developers and users in all software fields. Currently there is no industrial solution available that is not centralized and thus not dependent on the decisions of a few actors.

## Objective

Mitigate security and transparency issues arising from conventional software supply chain by providing a secure and convenient on-chain environment to operate on source code repositories. 

## Architecture

Trust management system has to be built in accordance with the following principles:

1. Entities are represented by hashes (container images, git commits);
2. Anyone can add some metadata with signature to any entity;
3. Anyone can decide whose metadata to trust;
4. Chain/tree of trust: dependencies can be organized using the same technique.

## Instruments and utilities

A variety of utility tools to assist with all the aspects of the solution are under active development. A sneak peek of the tool set to be released in the upcoming months:

- work with on-chain repository as if you use git repo with gosh helper: <link>
- build and sign images straight from git on chain (gosh)
    - (temporary solution) as a proof of concept you can start signing images [manually](https://github.com/tonlabs/gosh/tree/main/content-signature)
    - (coming soon) build images from signed on-chain source code ([fetching smart-contracts states](https://github.com/tonlabs/gosh/tree/main/buildkit))
- ensure youâ€™re using trusted docker images ([authentication signature check](https://github.com/tonlabs/gosh/tree/main/docker-extension))
