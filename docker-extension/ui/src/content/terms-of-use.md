<a name='risks' id='risks'></a>

## Risks

1. Prior to using the services, the User shall consider and acknowledge the following risks associated with digital assets and blockchains:
    - *Lack of professional expertise* in dealing with digital assets and blockchain-based software systems. We recommend using our service persons with sufficient experience with digital assets and blockchains or who have proficient knowledge about it. Users are solely responsible for ensuring relevant knowledge and experience in dealing with digital assets to ensure that the Users understand the risks associated with the services. 
    - *Price volatility.* In general, digital assets have been demonstrating extreme fluctuations in price over short periods of time. Therefore, the User hereby accepts and understands that the Company does not guarantee the market liquidity that might result in difficulty to buy, sell or own digital assets. 
    - *Security.* Digital assets may be subject to expropriation and or/theft. Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with the digital assets in a variety of ways. Furthermore, there is the risk that source code may contain intentional or unintentional bugs or weaknesses which may negatively affect the digital assets or result in the loss of User’s digital assets, the loss of User’s ability to access or control digital assets or the loss of any other assets;    
    - *Technology.* The Company is not responsible for the performance of open-source protocols. Forks and changes in relevant blockchains may result in significant and sudden changes to the value and/or usability of digital assets. The company will make its best attempt to inform its Users of an upcoming fork. However, the Company is not responsible for such loss of value of digital assets and bears no responsibility for any loss incurred by you while using the service or in any direct or indirect connection to the service.
    - *Legislation.* The regulatory status of digital assets and blockchain technology is unclear in many jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict how or whether governmental authorities may regulate such technologies. It is likewise difficult to predict how or whether any governmental authority may make changes to existing laws, regulations, or rules that may affect digital assets, blockchain technology, and its applications. Such changes could negatively impact digital assets in various ways. The company may cease the operations in a jurisdiction in the event that governmental actions make it unlawful or commercially undesirable to continue to do so. The User acknowledges and understands that the Company shall not be liable for any losses or damages (whether direct or indirect) caused by changes in regulatory and compliance requirements of the applicable laws and regulations.
    - *Other risks.* Digital assets are relatively new and dynamic technology. In addition to the risks included in the above discussion of risk factors, there are other risks associated with the purchase, holding and use of the digital assets, including those that we cannot anticipate. Such risks may further appear as unanticipated variations or combinations of the risks discussed above.
    
2. **No Warranty.** User understands that there is no warranty whatsoever on the services and digital assets, express or implied, to the extent permitted by law, and that the services are provided on an “as is” basis, and we don’t accept any charges, or claim of any nature from User for any delays, malfunction, errors, missing data, misrepresentation, omissions, etc. The User also understands that the Company will not provide any refund of the purchase price for digital assets under any circumstance except if explicitly stated otherwise in these Terms. The User further agrees to accept sole risk for using the services.
3. **Fraud Prevention.** In order to reduce the possibility of fraud, phishing attempts and other schemes perpetrated by malicious third parties, the User agrees not to respond directly to any inquiry regarding the user's credentials. The User understands that the Company may send him or her emails or other messages from time-to-time, but these notices will never ask for private keys and/or a mnemonic phrase.
