  <strong>GOSH</strong> is a blockchain built around securing the software
  supply chain and capturing the immense value in open source projects. This is
  achieved through record-setting blockchain tech, distributed programming, and
  a decentralized architecture - integrated into the same familiar git, meaning
  there is no change to the workflow.

<p>
  <strong>GOSH Docker Extension</strong> implements GOSH repository management
  and image verification as the newest feature of Docker - a Docker Extension.
</p>
<p>
  You will be able to create your GOSH account and Decentralized Autonomous
  Organization (DAO), set up and manage repositories through a graphical
  interface directly in Docker Desktop. Repositories stored in GOSH can then be
  interacted with like any regular remote repository, with a few small
  configurations to git, making decentralized code management easily available
  to anyone.
</p>
<p>
  Images built directly from code stored in GOSH can be verified as GOSH-sourced
  in the Docker Extension, ensuring security of the software supply chain. You
  will always know what code specifically is running in your containers, and
  that none of it was tampered with during build.
